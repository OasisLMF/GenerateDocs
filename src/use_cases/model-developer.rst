Model Developers
================

These sections will be relevant to people who would like to build models in Oasis. They will take you through the basics of 
representing hazard and vulnerability functions in the Oasis data format, how to map exposure data to the keys in the model 
data, how to run the Model Development Toolkit, and finally how to build and deploy a worker image to be used in the Oasis 
Platform.
