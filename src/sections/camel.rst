Introduction
************

Camel is a command line tool that automates processes for developers in our organisation. The have this tool in order to 
not only automate processes, but it reduces errors. It also acts as a sort of self-documentation. Keeping documentation on 
processes up to date can be tiring. You need to get the process working and then it's all too tempting to move onto the 
next feature or start using it instead of updating the documentation. This documentation lag can be completely cut with 
well-structured code that performs our processes. Someone can instantly see the most up-to-date process we use by just 
looking at the code that executes this process. However, before we use it we have to work with profiles.
