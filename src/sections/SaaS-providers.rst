SaaS Providers
==============

Whilst Oasis is open source and anyone can install and run it themselves for free, there are a number of companies offering 
services (and support) around Oasis which are commercial in nature. Some of these companies offer a hosted platform on 
which to run Oasis models, some have Oasis integrated into their own platforms and some offer a tradition support option 
for in-house Oasis deployments.

A few of these companies are listed below:
