Introduction

----

The Oasis User Interface (UI) is a web-browser application and is the front-end of the Oasis framework. It enables a user to 
import their exposure and financial data before executing a cat model. The results produced by the model are based on the 
user-defined outputs, which are extensively customisable, catering for most user requirements. The UI is simple and 
intuitive to use, and demonstration videos can be found below. There is an extended training video with voice instructions 
and a shorter “bitesize” version capturing the major components of the process.

The UI was designed primarily for model evaluations and to perform testing, rather than for core in/reinsurer portfolio rollups.

The Oasis UI enables the user to generate multiple output reports for several summary levels and perspectives in a single 
run. The Oasis kernel is a Monte-Carlo simulation that randomly samples the loss distribution. The number of samples is defined 
by the user and the level of convergence achieved across that sample set will vary depending on the model, portfolio, and as the 
required outputs.

There are two types of statistical outputs that can be delivered in the reports:
    * Numerically integrated – meaning the loss statistic is calculated directly from the underlying probability 
      distribution of loss.
    * Sample statistic – meaning the probability distributions of loss are sampled many times and the loss statistic is 
      calculated from that set of samples.

The list of available reports are as follows:
    * Sampled losses
    * Average annual loss and standard deviation
    * Event loss tables
    * Period loss tables
    * Single loss exceedance curve (AEP/OEP)
    * Multiple loss exceedance curve (AEP/OEP)

By summary levels:
    * Location
    * Line of business
    * County
    * State
    * Programme (whole portfolio)
    * Policy (insured loss only)

By Perspective:
    * Ground up
    * Insured loss

:doc:`Open Results Data (ORD) <../../sections/ORD>` tables can be selected and exported from the UI. More details of ORD can be 
found :doc:`here <../../sections/ORD>`

The user can generate an extensive suite of output reports for any exposure attribute, multiple summary levels and financial 
perspectives directly from the UI.
