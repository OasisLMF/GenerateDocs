Oasis UI
========

The Oasis User Interface (UI) is a web-browser application and is the front-end of the Oasis framework. It enables a user to 
import their exposure and financial data before executing a cat model. The results produced by the model are based on the 
user-defined outputs, which are extensively customisable, catering for most user requirements. The UI is simple and 
intuitive to use, and demonstration videos can be found below. There is an extended training video with voice instructions 
and a shorter “bitesize” version capturing the major components of the process.
