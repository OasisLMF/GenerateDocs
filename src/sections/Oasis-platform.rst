---------------------

The Oasis Loss Modelling Framework provides an open source platform for developing, deploying and executing catastrophe 
models. It uses a full simulation engine and makes no restrictions on the modelling approach. Models are packaged in a 
standard format and the components can be from any source, such as model vendors, academic and research groups. The 
platform provides:

* A platform for running catastrophe models, including a web based user interface and an API for integration with other 
  systems (Oasis Loss Modelling Framework)

* Core components for executing catastrophe models at scale and standard data formats for hazard and vulnerability (Oasis 
  ktools)

* Toolkit for developing, testing and deploying catastrophe models (Oasis Model Development Toolkit)

Platform architecture

A schematic of the Oasis Platform architecture is shown in the diagram below, and the components are described in the following table:

.. _hard_scaling:

hard-Scaling
************

The typical computation in oasis follows a split-apply-combine strategy, with the following modules:

- parametrization of eve does the split, indicating to generate a subset of the events
- eve, getmodel, gulcalc and fmcalc (insurance and re-insurance) does the apply,
  performing the computation to determine the different loss outputs for each subset of events.
- aalcalc and leccalc does the combine, computing the final results from the union of all the subsets.

Communication between the different modules are generally done via pipes or files
with fully specified data interfaces.

The basic parallelizable brick is:

 eve -> getmodel -> gulcalc -> fmcalc (insurance) -> fmcalc (re-insurance).

Parallelization is done at the process level and, therefore, can be achieve by using bigger
server with more processors. Scale up for large models and/or large portfolios.

Our performance testing has shown it provides good hard-scaling on single machine from
1 to 16 processors.
However above this, gain from adding processors start to decrease
and are even negative past 32 processors.
This is mainly due to the relative slowness of fmcalc compare to gulcalc that is stopping gulcalc
and slowing fmcalc by having too many context switches.

To overcome those limitation we are putting in place new approach.

- gul-fm load balancer (next release) that will split events out of the gul further
  and increase fmcalc parallelization.
- Oasis at scale (in test) will provide to the Oasis platform a way to split events
  on a cluster using celery with the ability to auto-scale depending on the workload size.

Weak Scaling
************

All of the components are packaged as Docker images.
Docker-compose can be used to deploy the system on one or more physical servers.
You can therefore increase the throughput of analysis by
provisioning more calculation servers and deploying more Analysis Worker images.

   From Development approach:


|
.. _development_approach:

Development approach
********************

1. We build open source software. This allows the community to directly
   review and critique our code and methodologies, and to contribute
   code for our review.

2. We use open source technology. We look to build on standard, modern
   technologies that will reduce the operational cost and/or improve the
   operational performance of models, that have solid support options
   for enterprise use, and that are free for general use.

3. We are building a full stack development team. Every team member
   should understand the system and technologies, be able to build and
   test the system and have a working knowledge of catastrophe
   modelling.

4. We use the community to drive development. We have direct access to
   many of the leading practitioners in the catastrophe modelling
   domain, and we get practical input through feature prioritization,
   specification and review of working software.

5. We use partnerships to provide scale, for hosting, support and
   non-core development.
