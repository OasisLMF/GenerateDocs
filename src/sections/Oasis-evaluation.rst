Oasis Evaluation
================

The Oasis Evalutaion repository can be use to spin up an Oasis enviroment to quickly and efficiently run and test models.
The Oasis Platform release now includes a full API for operating catastrophe models and a general consolidation of the 
platform architecture. Windows SQL server is no longer a strict requirement. The platform can be run via docker containers 
on a single machine or, if required, scaled up to run on a cluster.

Docker support is the main requirement for running the platform. A Linux based installation is the main focus of this 
example deployment. Running the install script from this repository automates install process of the OasisPlatform API v1, 
User Interface and example PiWind model.
