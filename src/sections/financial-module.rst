Financial Module and Exposure Data
==================================

The Oasis framework supports a wide range of financial calculation. Outputs can be generated for three perspectives:

* Ground-up: the underlying cost of loss,

* Insured loss: the loss ceded to the direct insurance contracts,

* Net loss: the insured loss net of resinsurance recoveries.

Exposure is uploaded in the OED exposure format. See `here <https://github.com/simplitium/oed>`_ for full details.
