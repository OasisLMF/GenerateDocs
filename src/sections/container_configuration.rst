Container Configuration
======================

.. _container_configuration:

:doc:`overview` | :doc:`platform_architecture` | :doc:`container_configuration` | :doc:`rest_api` | :doc:`distributed_execution`

There are two methods for setting configuration options on an oasis container. (1) by setting a shell environment variable on the container. (2) by adjusting a conf.ini file within the container.

Environment Variable Overrides
------------------------------

Configuration for OASIS Docker containers is primarily managed via a conf.ini file, which establishes default values. However, the **preferred and highest-precedence method for dynamic configuration is through shell environment variables.**

Naming Convention
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure an environment variable is recognized and applied, it must be prefixed with **OASIS_**. Any environment variable lacking this prefix will be ignored by the OASIS applications.

* **Example:** Setting OASIS_DEBUG=True will override the default DEBUG=False value found in the conf.ini file.

conf.ini Location and Loading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The canonical conf.ini file is located at OasisLMF/OasisPlatform/conf.ini within the OasisPlatform repository. This file provides the base configuration, but its effective path and how it's consumed differs based on the container type:

* **Model Worker Images:**
  
  * **Container Path:** /home/worker/conf.ini
  * **Integration:** Values from this conf.ini are loaded and directly influence the configuration within Celery's task processing files.

* **Server Images (Django):**
  
  * **Container Path:** /var/www/oasis/conf.ini
  * **Integration:** Values from this conf.ini are loaded into Django's settings.py configuration file, forming the application's core settings.

Precedence Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When an OASIS container starts, configuration values are applied in the following order of precedence, with later steps overriding earlier ones:

1. **conf.ini Defaults:** Values read from the conf.ini file ([default], [server], [worker], [celery] sections, respecting section-specific overrides).
2. **OASIS_ Prefixed Environment Variables:** Any environment variable set with the OASIS_ prefix (e.g., OASIS_DEBUG) will *always* override a corresponding setting derived from the conf.ini file.

This ensures that you can define sensible defaults within your image, while maintaining the flexibility to adjust specific parameters at deployment time using environment variables, without needing to rebuild or modify the container image itself.

Understanding conf.ini Structure and Precedence
-----------------------------------------------

The conf.ini file employs a standard INI file format, organized into sections, each containing key-value pairs. The sections define the scope of the configuration:

* **[default]**: This section contains settings that apply universally to all container types (servers and workers).
* **[server]**: Settings in this section are specific to server (e.g., Django) containers. Any key-value pair defined here will override a similarly named key in the [default] section when accessed by a server.
* **[worker]**: Similar to [server], this section holds configurations unique to worker containers. Settings here will override [default] settings for workers.
* **[celery]**: This section is dedicated to Celery-specific configuration options and applies to *both* server and worker container types, assuming both might interact with Celery.

Precedence Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. **Environment Variables (Highest Precedence):** An environment variable OASIS_SETTING_NAME_TO_GET=<value> will always override any setting, regardless of the conf.ini file. This provides the most dynamic and immediate way to adjust configurations without modifying the file itself.
2. **Specific Section Overrides Default:** For server containers, values in [server] take precedence over [default]. For worker containers, values in [worker] take precedence over [default].
3. **[celery] Section:** Settings within [celery] are additive and specifically for Celery. They don't directly override [default], [server], or [worker] in the same way, but rather provide a dedicated namespace for Celery configurations that both server and worker processes can utilize.

Server Container Configuration Options
--------------------------------------

These options are specifically applicable to the **coreoasis/api_server** containers and can be set via environment variables (prefixed with OASIS_, OASIS_{ini sections}_{variable}) or within the conf.ini file's [server] or [default] sections.

For example OASIS_DB_PASS=<value> or OASIS_SERVER_DB_PASS=<value> will both work.
