Oasis has a full REST API for managing exposure data and operating modelling workflows. API Swagger documentation can be 
found `here <http://api.oasislmfdev.org/swagger/>`_. An evaluation version of the Oasis platform and using can be deployed 
using the `Oasis evaluation repository <https://github.com/OasisLMF/OasisEvaluation>`_. This includes a Jupyter notebook 
that illustrates the basic operation of the API, using the Python API client.

The API schemas can be found here:

:doc:`../sections/platform_1`

:doc:`../sections/platform_2`

This is useful for more technical users who are looking to create their own UI or integrate Oasis with an existing 
system. The v1 schema hierarchy is shown in json format in right column of the page. An interactive version of the 
schema, with descriptions and examples, can be found below:

Oasis API
*********

----

The Oasis Platform release now includes a full API for operating catastrophe models and a general consolidation of the 
platform architecture. Windows SQL server is no longer a strict requirement. The platform can be run via docker containers 
on a single machine or, if required, scaled up to run on a cluster.

Docker support is the main requirement for running the platform. A Linux based installation is the main focus of this 
example deployment. Running the install script from this repository automates install process of the OasisPlatform API v1, 
User Interface and example PiWind model.

The **Oasis API** is the components of the Oasis platform that manages all the elements of the plaform that are required to 
build, run, and test models. The diagram below shows how the **Oasis API** sits behind the :doc:`Oasis-UI`, that you use to 
operate your catastrophe models.

API deployment in the Oasis Enterprise Platform
***********************************************

----

The **Oasis Enterprise Platform** is an open source `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/>`_ based, 
cloud computing cluster, which is deployable in `Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/
cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/>`_ via `Helm charts <https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/>`_ and `Bicep scripts 
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-script-bicep>`_ to setup the Azure cloud 
services. The diagram below sets out the **Oasis Enterprise Platform** architecture:
