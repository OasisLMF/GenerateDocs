## [v3.0.0](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ktools/releases/tag/v3.0.0)

* New features:
fmcalc supports recursion and extended set of calcrules for reinsurance calculations
fmcalc allocrule now a command line parameter
Filtering of zero loss records from fmcalc by default
aalcalc type 2 standard deviation now represents total sample variance, rather than sample mean variance
* Bug fixes: aalcalc standard deviation calculation corrected for multiple events within a period 
* Data formats: new format of fm_profile to support reinsurance calculations
* Test: all fm outputs (zeros removed) and aalcalc md5 changes
* Documentation: Updates for reinsurance
* Other: aalsummary component removed and aalcalc component restructured to run on summarycalc output
Fix example scripts to work with python3 as well as python2
Various performance improvements (additional condition checks and loop reductions, and reduced memory footprint requirements for fmcalc)

## [Release 2.0.3](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ktools/releases/tag/2.0.3)

* New features:
kat component added to concatenate multiple file inputs to support pipes
Added Visual Studio projects
Added Visual Studio 64-bit debug build support
Version number added to each component
* Bug fixes:
Handle empty output files

* Build: None
* Data formats: eltcalc output now has a 'type' field and includes analytical mean records as type 1.
* Test: md5 changes
* Documentation: minor fixes
* Other: None
