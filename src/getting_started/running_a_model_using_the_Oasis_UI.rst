Run a model using the Oasis UI
==============================

The Oasis User Interface (UI) is a web-browser application and the front-end of the Oasis framework.
It enables a user to import their exposure and financial data before executing a cat model. 
The results produced by the model are based on the user-defined outputs, which are extensively customisable, catering for most user requirements.
The UI is simple and intuitive to use, and demonstration videos can be found at the link below. 
There is an extended training video with voice instructions and a shorter “bitesize” version capturing the major components of the process.
